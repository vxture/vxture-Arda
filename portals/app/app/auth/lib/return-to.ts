/**
 * Allowlist for the post-login landing URL. arda is a single host, so we permit
 * only the configured public app host (the origin of redirectUri, which equals
 * arda.vxture.com / beta-arda.vxture.com / dev localhost) and the configured
 * cookie host. No subdomain wildcard: we deliberately do NOT accept sibling
 * *.vxture.com hosts. Anything else is rejected to prevent an open redirect.
 *
 * Relative returnTo values resolve against the canonical app origin, never the
 * request host: behind the edge proxy the request host is the internal bind
 * (0.0.0.0:3230), so resolving against it would store/redirect to that host.
