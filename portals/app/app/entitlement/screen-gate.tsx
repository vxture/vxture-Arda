 * Server-side per-screen gate (biz-300 stage 0, route-layout layer of the
 * three-layer defense). Two orthogonal axes, both evaluated on the server so
 * locked data never reaches the client payload:
 *
 * - Role axis first (admin screens): non-admins get access-denied. Checked
 *   before the subscription axis - an upgrade prompt would mislead here,
 *   since buying a tier cannot grant a role.
 * - Subscription axis (visible-but-locked): the nav entry stays, but a
 *   feature above the tier renders the upgrade interstitial.
 *
 * No feature mapping, or all axes pass -> children unchanged. Missing
 * subscription is handled above us (EntitlementGate fail-closed); here we
 * fail-locked to the panel for consistency.
